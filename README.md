# Productivity Dashboard - Week 1 Setup

## 🎉 Your App Foundation is Ready!

I've built the complete project structure with tab navigation, dark theme, and your green aesthetic. Here's how to get it running.

---

## 📋 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Copy the Project to Your Mac

1. Download the entire `productivity-dashboard` folder from this chat
2. Place it somewhere easy to find (like your Desktop or Documents folder)
3. Open Terminal on your Mac

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project

```bash
# Replace this path with wherever you put the folder
cd ~/Desktop/productivity-dashboard
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

This will download all the necessary packages. It might take 2-3 minutes.

```bash
npm install
```

You'll see a bunch of text scrolling - that's normal! Wait for it to finish.

### Step 4: Launch the App

```bash
npm run electron:dev
```

The app should open in a new window! 🚀

## ✅ What to Check

When the app launches, you should see:

1. **Dark background** with green accents
2. **Sidebar on the left** with 4 tabs:
   - Dashboard (home icon)
   - Canvas (book icon)
   - Stats (chart icon)
   - Settings (gear icon)
3. **Smooth animations** when switching tabs
4. **Placeholder content** in each tab showing what's coming

---

## 🧪 Testing Tasks

Please test these things and let me know if anything doesn't work:

1. **Click each tab** - does it switch smoothly?
2. **Resize the window** - does the layout adjust?
3. **Check the colors** - does the green glow look good?
4. **Read each placeholder** - do you understand what's coming in each week?

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Error: "command not found: npm"
- Node.js isn't installed or not in your PATH
- Run: `brew install node`
- Then try Step 3 again

### Error: "Cannot find module..."
- Dependencies didn't install properly
- Try: `npm install --force`

### App doesn't open
- Check Terminal for error messages
- Make sure port 5173 isn't being used by another app
- Try closing and re-running: `npm run electron:dev`

### Animations are choppy
- This shouldn't happen, but let me know - might be a performance issue

## 📸 Take a Screenshot!

Once it's running, take a screenshot of the dashboard and share your first impressions:
- Does it feel smooth?
- Do you like the colors?
- Anything you want adjusted before we continue?

---

## 🎯 What's Next (Week 2)

Once you confirm everything works, we'll build:
- Task creation system
- Task list with checkboxes
- Satisfying completion animations
- Basic calendar view
- Local data storage
